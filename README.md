# IPAM Lab

This is just me playing around with [AWS IPAM.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/what-it-is-ipam.html)

You can find my blog post on it [here.](https://incpac.github.io/posts/2024-04-20-playing-around-with-aws-ipam/)

It's split up into four stacks.

- Lab 01: Setting up IPAM and a VPC in a single account/region
- Lab 02: Single account, multiple regions
- Lab 03: Failed attempt to go multi-account
- Lab 04: Integrate with AWS Organizations, delegate an account to manage IPAM, create a VPC in a different account/region
